	 <img src="https://welovecatsandkittens.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bookstore-6.jpg" class="image5" title="Little cutie pie"><img src="https://welovecatsandkittens.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bookstore-8.jpg" class="image5" title="Little cutie pie"></a>In Nova Scotia, Canada, a bookstore has found an ingenious way to find new homes for the orphaned kittens in its community. Otis & Clementine’s Books and Coffee acts as a foster home for a multitude of kitties in the hope that the locals popping by to pick up a book or two may decide to leave with one of the cats looking for a forever home. The kittens all come from local rescue South Paw Conservation Nova Scotia, they hope that customers at the bookshop will fall in love and provide them with a forever home. All of the kittens live in the store round-the-clock and have free rein to explore the shelves, sleep, play and cuddle the customers.Visitors are encouraged to relax on one of the store’s many couches with a good book and a kitty to cuddle or play with.
	 Ellen Helmke, the store’s owner, came up with the idea to use space in her store to help the cats and kittens get adopted, because who can refuse the lure of a cuddly kitten. Thirty cats have already found their forever homes since Ellen set up the adoption program last year. Great news for both kittens and customers.
	 The delightful felines often surprise those who walk in the door for the first time, not expecting to be greeted by a furry friend. The bookstore doubles up as a coffee shop and seems like the perfect place to spend a few hours for anyone who finds themselves in the area. Let’s face it, there’s nothing better than curling up with a good book, a steaming cup of coffee, and a cuddly cat.
